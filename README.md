Hello my name is James but you can refer to me as brokesyntax01 and here are a few things about myself. First, I have always been around technology, specifically computers. My fascination
with computers all started with my parents playing a game called "Bow and Arrow" which was a silly game where you're a robin-hood like character and the objective was to pop all balloons, with each round increasing in difficulty. Furthermore, to picture how this game looked, I pits your character to left with the only options for movement were up & down and to the right were the incoming balloons which were supported by an evergreen backdrop. 
For this project, I will be showcasing the skilled I have acquired so far and how to implement them for the creation of a recipe website.
